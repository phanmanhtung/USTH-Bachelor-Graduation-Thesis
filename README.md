# Bachelor-Graduation-Thesis
For my graduation thesis, I had a three-month internship in the ICT Lab under the supervision of PhD. Doan Nhat Quang. My project topic is “Text Mining and Trend Detection”, a project in the field of Natural Language Processing. I worked with about 30 thousands raw articles, the major goals were to cluster them into some big topics and to detect the trend o each topic. The methods I used were Regex, Stemming, Word Removal for data preprocessing, K-means Clustering, LDA for topic identification and LSTM for trend detection. I utilized various NLP packages in Python for the project.
